# Mystic-Engine

Mystic Engine is a game engine by Tat/ThatRandomGamer, I aim to learn how to make basic game engines with this. Currently only a very basic renderer is 
implemented,more features to come soon. This engine might be used for some learning projects or game jam stuff, I dont plan to make large scale
games with this, nor is that the purpose of this engine. Even after initial batch of features are done, Ill still keep updating this for a long time,
adding new and improving pre existing features.

This project uses OpenGL 3.3 (soon to be upgraded to 4.3 which is the max my gpu supports, then 4.5 when I get a new gpu), which is implemented via
Glad and GLFW. I also use OpenGl M, a maths library for OpenGl. Vulkan, DX12 Ultimate support is planned. I will be using OpenAL soft as my audio
library, will add more stuff later. I will be using my own physics engine(might add support for Bullet but I wanna learn how to make my own).

##Current Feature Roadmap: 
- Advanced Lighting
- Different texture map support
- Physics including basic soft and hard body, cloth, particles and fluids simulation.
- Basic audio handling
- Scene system

##Future features that maybe added:
- Advanced physics sims
- Fully PBR rendering as well as support for cell/cartoon aesthetics
- Engine GUI 
- Advanced audio and stuff like spatial audio, realistic audio bounce etc
- Material system
- Improved particle and vfx system
- Node based approach to procedrual material, audio and vfx
- Camera features to mimic irl cameras
- Blender animation support
- Ray Tracing support
- Non RT Global Illumination
- LOD support
- Tesselation
- Material Painting support
- Can be used as a basic alternative to Substance Designer/Quixel Mixer and Substance Painter
- Visual Scripting
- C#/Lua scripting 
- Modding support for games made using engine
